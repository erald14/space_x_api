ParkDepot challenge.

Notes:
1: The list view isnt fully responsive and doesnt look so good, as I ran out of time
2: there isnt a global state or shared state setup, instead I tried to share data using a hook, which in a big/real project doesnt scale well.
3: I used mantine UI for the Ui Components
